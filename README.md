# Pokemon Type Matchup

Tool that allows a user to select up to two pokemon move-types to see the effectiveness of other types against the chosen combination.
Although the newest iteration of the series provides this information, it only does so after you've encountered a specific pokemon.

I'm hoping to integrate a lookup service to automatically use the types of a selected pokemon in the future;
however, there does not seem to be services that have gen 7 data.

## Motivation
The tool was created mainly as way to practice using the [Angular](https://angular.io/) development framework.
