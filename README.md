# Pokemon Type Matchup

Tool that allows a user to select up to two pokemon move-types from below to see the effectiveness of other types against the chosen combination.
Although the newest iteration of the series provides this information, it only does so after you've encounted a specific pokemon.

I'm hoping to integrate a lookup service in the future; however, there does not seem to be services that have gen 7 data.

## Motivation
The tool was created mainly as way to practice using the [Angular](https://angular.io/) development framework.
